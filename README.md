A Little Bit About Myself :

Hi, I'm Ayush, a first-year B.Tech CSE student. I'm passionate about web development and constantly exploring new technologies. I enjoy solving complex coding problems and creating responsive designs. Currently, I'm working on building my skills with CSS Grid and responsive layouts while balancing my studies and tech 


Challenges Faced

1. Mastering CSS Grid: Initially, I found it tricky to get the grid layout working responsively, especially with the auto-fill and minmax properties.


2. Design and Alignment: Ensuring the cards looked good across all screen sizes while keeping the layout consistent, especially aligning the button at the bottom, was a bit challenging.


3. Mobile Responsiveness: I struggled with making the text and buttons readable and clickable on smaller screens without breaking the layout.


4. Hover Effects: It took some effort to create subtle hover effects without making the layout shift too much.
