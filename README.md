A Little Bit About Myself :

Hi, I'm Ayush, a first-year B.Tech CSE student. I'm passionate about web development and constantly exploring new technologies. I enjoy solving complex coding problems and creating responsive designs. Currently, I'm working on building my skills with CSS Grid and responsive layouts while balancing my studies and tech projects.

Challenges Faced

1. Mastering CSS Grid: I initially found it difficult to make the grid layout fully responsive, especially when adjusting card sizes for different screens.


2. Design Consistency: Aligning the content and button consistently across different card sizes while maintaining a clean layout was challenging.


3. Mobile Responsiveness: Ensuring the cards looked good on smaller screens, with readable text and clickable buttons, required fine-tuning through media queries.


4. Hover Effects: Creating subtle hover animations without disrupting the layout was tricky and took multiple adjustments.
